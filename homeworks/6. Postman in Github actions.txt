You already have a node.js express api (for Shop and ShopItem management)
You already have a Postman collection to test this application.

The goal is to have these tests working in github actions.

You have a working Postman pipeline example in .github/workflows/blank.yml
Copy this pipeline, change the collection name to yours.
